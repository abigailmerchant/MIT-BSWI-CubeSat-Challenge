Welcome to our repository for the 2024 MIT Beaver Works Summer Institute (BWSI) Build a CubeSat Challenge! ðŸŽ‰

As part of this program, our team works on designing and building a CubeSat to enhance flood response efforts by providing real-time data and coordination tools for disaster relief teams.

ðŸŒŸ Our Goals:

Develop a CubeSat capable of detecting and monitoring flood-prone areas.
Provide real-time data transmission for early warnings and disaster mitigation.
Create tools to aid in effective resource allocation during flood events.
Stay tuned as we document our journey through design, testing, and implementation! ðŸš€
